        New York City, often called simply New York and abbreviated as NYC, is
        the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2019
        population of 8,336,817 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784
        km <sup>2</sup>), New York City is also the most densely populated major
        city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the U.S. state
        of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area,
        the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass. With
        almost 20 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and
        approximately 23 million in its combined statistical area, it is one of
        the world's most populous megacities. New York City has been described
        as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world,
        significantly influencing commerce, entertainment, research, technology,
        education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the
        headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for
        international diplomacy.

        The Wild Atlantic Way (Irish: Slí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin) is a tourism
        trail on the west coast, and on parts of the north and south coasts, of
        Ireland. The 2,500 km (1,553 mile) driving route passes through nine
        counties and three provinces, stretching from County Donegal's Inishowen
        Peninsula in Ulster to Kinsale, County Cork, in Munster, on the Celtic
        Sea coast. <br />
        There are 157 discovery points, 1,000 attractions and more than 2,500
        activities. The route was officially launched in 2014 by Minister of
        State for Tourism and Sport, Michael Ring, T.D.

      <p>
        Dalmatia (/dælˈmeɪʃə, -tiə/; Croatian: Dalmacija [dǎlmaːtsija]; Italian:
        Dalmazia; see names in other languages) is one of the four historical
        regions of Croatia, alongside Croatia proper, Slavonia, and Istria.
        <br />
        Dalmatia is a narrow belt of the east shore of the Adriatic Sea,
        stretching from the island of Rab in the north to the Bay of Kotor in
        the south. The hinterland (Dalmatian Zagora) ranges in width from fifty
        kilometres in the north, to just a few kilometres in the south; it is
        mostly covered by the rugged Dinaric Mountains. Seventy-nine islands
        (and about 500 islets) run parallel to the coast, the largest (in
        Dalmatia) being Brač, Pag, and Hvar. The largest city is Split, followed
        by Zadar and Šibenik. <br />
        The name of the region stems from an Illyrian tribe called the Dalmatae,
        who lived in the area in classical antiquity. Later it became a Roman
        province, and as result a Romance culture emerged, along with the
        now-extinct Dalmatian language, later largely replaced with related
        Venetian. With the arrival of Croats to the area in the 8th century, who
        occupied most of the hinterland, Croatian and Romance elements began to
        intermix in language and culture.

        39.5 million residents across a total area of about 163,696 square miles
        (423,970 km<sup>2</sup>), California is the most populous U.S. state and

        subnational entity in North America, and has its state capital in
        Sacramento. The Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area
        are the nation's second- and fifth-most populous urban regions, with
        18.7 million and 9.7 million residents respectively. Los Angeles is
        California's most populous city, and the country's second-most populous,

      <p>
        Western Australia (abbreviated as WA) is a state occupying the western
        32.9 percent of the land area of Australia excluding external
        territories. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean to the north and west,
        and the Southern Ocean to the south, the Northern Territory to the
        north-east, and South Australia to the south-east. Western Australia is
        Australia's largest state, with a total land area of 2,527,013 square
        kilometres (975,685 sq mi), and the second-largest country subdivision
        in the world, surpassed only by Russia's Sakha Republic. As of 2017, the
        state has about 2.6 million inhabitants – around 11 percent of the
        national total – of whom the vast majority (92 percent) live in the
        south-west corner, 79 percent of the population living in the Perth
        area, leaving the remainder of the state sparsely populated. <br />
        The first Europeans to visit Western Australia belonged to the Dutch
        Dirk Hartog expedition, who visited the Western Australian coast in
        1616. The first permanent European settlement of Western Australia
        occurred following the landing by Major Edmund Lockyer on 26 December
        1826 of an expedition on behalf of the New South Wales colonial
        government, although Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort—the oldest surviving
        European building in Australia—was built 197 years prior in 1629 on West
        Wallabi Island in Western Australia by survivors of the Batavia
        shipwreck and massacre. Lockyer established a convict-supported military
        garrison at King George III Sound, at present-day Albany, and on 21
        January 1827[5] formally took possession for the British Crown of the
        western part of the continent that was not already claimed by the
        British Crown. This was followed by the establishment of the Swan River
        Colony in 1829, including the site of the present-day capital, Perth.

        New Plymouth (Māori: Ngāmotu) is the major city of the Taranaki Region
        on the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand. It is named after
        the English city of Plymouth from where the first English settlers to
        New Zealand migrated. The New Plymouth District, which includes New
        Plymouth City and several smaller towns, is the 10th largest district
        (out of 67) in New Zealand, and has a population of 84,400 – about
        two-thirds of the total population of the Taranaki Region and 1.7% of
        New Zealand's population. This includes New Plymouth City (55,300),
        Waitara (7,040), Inglewood (3,640), Ōakura (1,640), Ōkato (561) and
        Urenui (429). The city itself is a service centre for the region's
        principal economic activities including intensive pastoral activities
        (mainly dairy farming) as well as oil, natural gas and petrochemical
        exploration and production. It is also the region's financial centre as
        the home of the TSB Bank (formerly the Taranaki Savings Bank), the
        largest of the remaining non-government New Zealand-owned banks.

        Victoria (abbreviated as Vic) is a federated state in southeastern
        Australia, and politically a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. It
        is Australia's second-most populated state, and also the second-smallest
        state with a land area of 237,659 km<sup>2</sup> (91,761 sq mi), making
        it the most densely populated state in Australia (26.56 per
        km<sup>2</sup>). Victoria is bordered with New South Wales to the north
        and South Australia to the west, and is bounded by the Bass Strait
        (which separates it from the island state of Tasmania) to the south,the
        Great Australian Bight portion of the Southern Ocean to the southwest,
        and the Tasman Sea (a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean) to the
        southeast. The state encompasses a range of climates and geographical
        features from its temperate coastal and central regions to the Victorian
        Alps in the north-east and the semi-arid north-west. Victoria has a
        population of over 6.6 million,the majority of which is concentrated in
        the central south area surrounding Port Phillip Bay, and in particular
        in the metropolitan area of Greater Melbourne, Victoria's state capital
        and largest city and also Australia's second-largest city, where over
        three quarters of the Victorian population live. The state is home to
        four of Australia's 20 largest cities: Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat and
        Bendigo. The population is diverse, with 35.1% of inhabitants being
        immigrants.
